# Chicken Run

Chicken Run is a private project that I started because I enjoy coding. The game is a simple but challenging arcade game that is continuously evolving.

## Game Description

The game starts with a title screen where you have two options:

- **New Game**: Start a new game and try to collect as many coins as possible.
- **High Score**: (not implemented yet)

### Gameplay

When you click on "New Game," the actual game begins. Your task is to navigate through the field, collect coins, and reach the other end to advance to the next level. With each level, more coins appear to increase your score for the high score, and the cars trying to stop you get faster.

- You have **3 lives**. If you lose all your lives, the game ends.
- Each level brings more coins and faster cars, making the game progressively harder.

## Goal of the Game

Collect as many coins as possible and reach the other end of the field to advance to the next level. Can you keep improving your high score?
